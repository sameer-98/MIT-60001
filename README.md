Coded problem sets from MIT OpenCourseWare. The problem sets are part of the 60001 course. By completing this course, I have gained experience with computer science concepts such as abstraction, decomposition, polymorphism, and inheritance. Additionally, I have learned about the importance of complexity in algorithm design and use of classes as abstract data types.
